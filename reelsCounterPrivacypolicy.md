Privacy Policy for Reels Counter

Last updated: October 2, 2025

📌 Introduction

Reels Counter ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

📂 Information We Collect
🔹 Local Data Only

Usage Counts: The app stores simple counters of your content consumption locally on your device

Timestamps: Date and time information for when you use the counter feature

No Personal Information: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information

🔹 Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences

No data is transmitted to external servers

No data is shared with third parties

⚙️ How We Use Your Information

The app uses your local data only to:

Display your daily and total consumption counts

Provide historical tracking of your usage patterns

Maintain app functionality

🎥 Auto-Scroll Feature & Accessibility Service
🔹 What is Auto-Scroll?

The auto-scroll feature is an optional functionality that automatically scrolls through content (like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikTok videos) while you're away from your device.

This helps you:

Simulate natural viewing patterns when you're not actively using your phone

Continue content consumption tracking even during passive viewing

Maintain consistent usage statistics for better habit tracking

🔹 Why We Need Accessibility Service Permission

The Accessibility Service permission is required for the auto-scroll feature because:

Content Detection: It allows the app to identify video content areas on your screen

Safe Scrolling: It ensures scrolling only happens in video areas, avoiding buttons or ads

Cross-App Compatibility: It works across different social media apps (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat)

User Safety: It prevents accidental interactions with unintended UI elements

🔹 Important Notes About Accessibility Service

✅ Completely Optional: You can use the counter without enabling auto-scroll

✅ User Controlled: You manually enable/disable it in Android Settings

✅ No Data Collection: The service only performs scroll gestures, no data is read or stored

✅ Privacy Focused: It cannot access your personal information, messages, or account details

✅ Transparent Operation: All actions are visible on your screen

🔹 How Auto-Scroll Works

You enable the accessibility service in Android Settings (optional)

The app detects when you're viewing supported content

It performs gentle swipe gestures in safe video areas only

It automatically increments your content counter

You can disable it anytime through Android Settings

🔹 What the Accessibility Service CANNOT Do

❌ Read your personal messages or data

❌ Access your accounts or passwords

❌ Interact with other apps beyond scrolling

❌ Send or receive any information

❌ Modify your device settings

🔒 Data Security

All data remains on your device

No internet connection is required for core functionality

No data transmission occurs

🧑‍💻 Your Rights

Access: You can view all your data within the app

Deletion: You can clear all data using the "Clear All Data" feature in the app

Control: You have full control over when the overlay feature is active

📱 Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

Display over other apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) → Required for the floating counter button functionality

Foreground service → Required to keep the overlay button active in the background

Wake lock → Prevents the device from sleeping while the overlay is active

Internet access → Used only for navigating to device settings when needed

Accessibility service (BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE) → Optional feature for auto-scroll functionality that automatically scrolls through content.

This permission allows the app to perform touch gestures on your screen to scroll through videos.

User must explicitly enable this in Android Settings.

This service only performs scrolling actions and cannot read, access, or transmit any personal data.

Battery optimization exemption → Ensures the overlay service runs reliably

⚠️ Important: All permissions are used solely for app functionality. No data is collected or transmitted through these permissions.
