# Privacy Policy for Reels Counter

**Last updated: October 2, 2025**

## Introduction

Reels Counter ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Information We Collect

### Local Data Only
- **Usage Counts**: The app stores simple counters of your content consumption locally on your device
- **Timestamps**: Date and time information for when you use the counter feature
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information

### Data Storage
- All data is stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No data is shared with third parties

## How We Use Your Information

The app uses your local data only to:
- Display your daily and total consumption counts
- Provide historical tracking of your usage patterns
- Maintain app functionality

## Auto-Scroll Feature & Accessibility Service

### What is Auto-Scroll?
The auto-scroll feature is an optional functionality that automatically scrolls through content (like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikTok videos) while you're away from your device. This helps you:
- **Simulate natural viewing patterns** when you're not actively using your phone
- **Continue content consumption tracking** even during passive viewing
- **Maintain consistent usage statistics** for better habit tracking

### Why We Need Accessibility Service Permission
The **Accessibility Service** permission is required for the auto-scroll feature because:

1. **Content Detection**: It allows the app to identify video content areas on your screen
2. **Safe Scrolling**: It ensures scrolling only happens in video areas, avoiding buttons or ads
3. **Cross-App Compatibility**: It works across different social media apps (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat)
4. **User Safety**: It prevents accidental interactions with unintended UI elements

### Important Notes About Accessibility Service:
- ✅ **Completely Optional**: You can use the counter without enabling auto-scroll
- ✅ **User Controlled**: You manually enable/disable it in Android Settings
- ✅ **No Data Collection**: The service only performs scroll gestures, no data is read or stored
- ✅ **Privacy Focused**: It cannot access your personal information, messages, or account details
- ✅ **Transparent Operation**: All actions are visible on your screen

### Accessibility Service Data Access Declaration:
**What data we access through Accessibility Service:**
- Screen content to detect video/reel areas for safe scrolling
- Window information to identify supported social media apps
- Touch interaction capabilities to perform scroll gestures

**How we use this data:**
- Only to detect and count reels in supported apps (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat)
- To automatically scroll through content when auto-scroll is enabled
- Data is processed locally in real-time and never stored or transmitted

**What we DO NOT access:**
- Personal messages, emails, or text content
- Passwords, login credentials, or account information
- Photos, videos, or media files
- Contact information or personal data
- Any data outside of the specific scroll detection functionality

### How Auto-Scroll Works:
1. You enable the accessibility service in Android Settings (optional)
2. The app detects when you're viewing supported content
3. It performs gentle swipe gestures in safe video areas only
4. It automatically increments your content counter
5. You can disable it anytime through Android Settings

### What the Accessibility Service CANNOT Do:
- ❌ Read your personal messages or data
- ❌ Access your accounts or passwords
- ❌ Interact with other apps beyond scrolling
- ❌ Send or receive any information
- ❌ Modify your device settings

## Data Security

- All data remains on your device
- No internet connection is required for core functionality
- No data transmission occurs

## Your Rights

- **Access**: You can view all your data within the app
- **Deletion**: You can clear all data using the "Clear All Data" feature in the app
- **Control**: You have full control over when the overlay feature is active

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:
- **Display over other apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW)**: Required for the floating counter button functionality
- **Foreground service**: Required to keep the overlay button active in the background
- **Wake lock**: Prevents the device from sleeping while the overlay is active
- **Internet access**: Used only for navigating to device settings when needed
- **Accessibility service (BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE)**: Optional feature for auto-scroll functionality that automatically scrolls through content. This permission allows the app to perform touch gestures on your screen to scroll through videos. User must explicitly enable this in Android Settings. This service only performs scrolling actions and cannot read, access, or transmit any personal data.
- **Battery optimization exemption**: Ensures the overlay service runs reliably

**Important**: All permissions are used solely for app functionality. No data is collected or transmitted through these permissions.
