Privacy Policy for Reels Counter

Last updated: November 2, 2025

Introduction

Reels Counter ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

Information We Collect

Local Data Only

Usage Counts: The app stores simple counters of your content consumption locally on your device.

Timestamps: Date and time information for when you use the counter feature.

No Personal Information: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Android’s SharedPreferences.

No data is transmitted to external servers.

No data is shared with third parties.

How We Use Your Information

The app uses your local data only to:

Display your daily and total consumption counts.

Provide historical tracking of your usage patterns.

Maintain app functionality.

Auto-Scroll Feature & Accessibility Service
What is Auto-Scroll?

The auto-scroll feature is an optional functionality that automatically scrolls through content (like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikTok videos) while you're away from your device. This helps you:

Simulate natural viewing patterns when you're not actively using your phone.

Continue content consumption tracking even during passive viewing.

Maintain consistent usage statistics for better habit tracking.

Why We Need Accessibility Service Permission

The Accessibility Service permission is required for the auto-scroll feature because:

Content Detection: It allows the app to identify video content areas on your screen.

Safe Scrolling: It ensures scrolling only happens in video areas, avoiding buttons or ads.

Cross-App Compatibility: It works across different social media apps (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat).

User Safety: It prevents accidental interactions with unintended UI elements.

Important Notes About Accessibility Service:
✅ Completely Optional
✅ User Controlled
✅ No Data Collection
✅ Privacy Focused
✅ Transparent Operation
